# An Example Project Using Lucia Auth with Next.js

Next Auth is frustrating to use. It's like the authors think they're smarter people and show off their achievements taking it granted that you are as smart as them. Or worse, maybe they don't give a sh*t whether you understand their library or not.

My use case is simple:

- Username and password authentication
- Restricting access to certain pages according to user privileges
- Showing different UI for some pages according to user privileges.

Next Auth set so many road blocks for me to implement such a simple feature, and drove me to switch to Lucia which provides an much more elegant solution.

I'm sure that my next new project will not be using Next.js.
